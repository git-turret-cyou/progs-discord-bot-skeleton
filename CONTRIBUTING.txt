HI! thank you for wanting to contribute to my project.

only asks are that you follow the coding style already established (i try to
do this aswell so come at me)

i can take patches via github PRs or email (turret@duck.com)
have something you want to add to, but its not in TODO? go ahead and send in
your patch anyway!

licensing? at time of writing, i need to find out what license i want to
release this as. if you're contributing, please make sure to sign-off your
commit, certifying to the contributor certificate-of-origin
