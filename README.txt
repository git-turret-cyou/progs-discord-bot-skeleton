turret.'s discord bot skeleton for C99

see TODO.txt and CONTRIBUTING.txt if you want to lend a hand!

not finished
release date unknown at time of writing

- building
`make`! thats all.

- errors
uh oh! i have github issues enabled on the github mirror
(https://github.com/git-turret-cyou/progs-discord-bot-skeleton). you can file
an issue or email me directly (will likely be placed on the issue tracker)
(turret@duck.com)

- using
take a look in the example/ folder!
with the way the skeleton's build system is setup, all of the example files are added
you can set TOKEN= in your environment or write a .env file with your token in it and
the system will login as that bot and register all of the commands in the examples.

additionally, we try to keep all of the examples independent. you can add and remove files
dictating commands without editing any other file! gotta love magic.
