TODO:

ALSO
> grep 'TODO' . -R
there are todos embedded in the code :steamhappy:

- Discord Websockets
 - authentication
 - reconnecting/resuming

- Name initcall levels
    l1: DBS internals initialisation
    l2:
    l3: event registration
    l4: commands & other interactions
    l5: subsystems start (websocket, events start, etc)

- command registration API

- Redo logging (unnecessarily complex?)
- Add define to enable/disable built-in logging?

- program portability
   (processor portability? maybe)
   (os kernel portability? most likely not)
