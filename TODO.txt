ALSO
> grep 'TODO' . -R
there are todos embedded in the code :steamhappy:

- Discord Websockets
 - authentication
 - reconnecting/resuming

- Name initcall levels
    l1: DBS internals initialisation
    l2:
    l3: event registration, commands declaration
    l4: commands & other interactions registration
    l5: subsystems start (websocket, events start, etc)

- command registration API

- Redo logging (unnecessarily complex?)
- Add define to enable/disable built-in logging?

- program portability
  - use pthreads
  - use mutex
  - use pselect instead of signalfd for subsys
  - many more.....
  - its easier to make it more portable in c11
  - consider c11
  - use posix files instead of bare fds
  - (incl weird pipe system for http requests)

- find portable solution for initcalls
- either that.. or change makefile to see processor and switch linker script dynamically
    (ie for arm processors with cheap oracle vm or smthn)
